            </ul>
            <h2 id="section3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><em>In Short:</em> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
            <p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
                <!-- Add the rest of the list items -->
            </ul>

            <h2 id="section4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><em>In Short:</em> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
            <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                <!-- Add any other situations -->
            </ul>
            <h2 id="section5">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
            <p><em>In Short:</em> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
            <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
            <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

            <h2 id="section6">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <h2 id="section7">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <p><em>In Short:</em> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

            <h2 id="section8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p><em>In Short:</em> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

                <li>not to be subject to automated decision-making.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
            <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
            <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
            <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>

            <h2 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p><em>In Short:</em> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
